# Razer Hydra Driver for SteamVR
The driver emulates HTC Vive controllers.

## Buttons
Vive controller | Razer Hydra
------------ | -------------
System button | Middle button
Application menu button | Button 4
Grip button | Bumper
Touchpad button | Joystick button


In some games, it is inconvenient to click Joystick, but this can be edited in SteamVR Bindings UI, if you go to the SteamVR settings, click "Advance Settings" -> "Show" and go to the controllers item.

### Actions
Description | Razer Hydra button
------------ | -------------
Crouch | Button 3


For HMD can use any driver that supports button crouch. Can use the [TrueOpenVR and SteamVR bridge driver](https://github.com/TrueOpenVR) for HMD (FreeTrack for HMD from smartphones or ArduinoHMD for [full-fledged DIY HMD](https://github.com/TrueOpenVR/TrueOpenVR-DIY/blob/master/HMD/HMD.md)). While pressing button 3 on the Razer Hydra the keyboard button is pressed (the button is configurable). Crouch settings can be found in the configuration file "default.vrsettings".

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/r57zone/Razer-Hydra-SteamVR-driver/releases/) the latest driver.
2. Unpack archive to "..\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers".
3. [Add option](https://youtu.be/QCA3m4_3IJM?t=197) `"activateMultipleDrivers" : true,` to config "steamvr.vrsettings", to "steamvr" section.
4. Change the dead zone if your stick goes to the side in config (..\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\razer_hydra\hydra\resources\settings\default.vrsettings), option "JoyStickDeadZone". To determine the value of the dead zone can use [this program](https://github.com/r57zone/Sixence-Razer-Hydra-sample/releases).
